### Acceptance checklist

<!--
  As part of SOC2/GN-104 and SOC2/GN-105 requirements, all pull requests are REQUIRED to
  go through our acceptance checklist linked below. Once you have reviewed the checklist
  against your pull request, please check the checkbox by filling it in with an 'x', for
  example: '- [x]'.

  ⚠️ If you opt to not meet the acceptance checklist above (e.g. by not awaiting a full
  review, deciding to not include tests, etc.) please DO NOT check the checklist item
  below, and instead provide a brief explanation below the checklist item.
